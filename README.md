# Predict-Sales-Revenue

Predict the total sales revenue using LSTM model from all products sold from January 1, 2018 through January 7, 2018 using historic sales data.

- Extracted Groceries Retail sales data from Amazon S3
- Conducted Explorary Data Analysis (EDA) on data with time series plot
- Pre-processed data with MinMaxScaler 
- Build LSTM model and Optimized model performance by tuning hyperparameters
- Validate the model on test data and calculate performance metrics such as MSE, RMSE
- Make prediction based on the model
- Create a scatter plot to visualize the actual vs. predicted sales revenue to determine the appropriateness of the prediction
